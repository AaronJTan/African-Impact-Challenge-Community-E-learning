## Motivation
The aim of our project is to construct a community and e-learning platform to be used by young, aspiring African entrepreneurs partaking in the African Impact Challenge. This platform will allow them to undergo educational training and attend workshops that will aid them in their journey as entrepreneurs. Furthermore, this platform will allow for users to easily collaborate and network through various mediums such as a discussion board and direct messaging. An important reason for this is to faciliate communication between entrepreneurs and potential partners that may want to partner with their startup. Another crucial reason for this is so that the entrepreneurs can easily ask questions and form discussions about the educational content they consume.

## Installation
- For our project we’ve decided to use the “PERN” stack; which essentially stands for:
    - Postgresql
    - Express.js
    - React
    - Node.js

The installation instructions for each go as follows:
- Postgresql (latest version - 13 for both Windows and MacOS):
    - For detailed instructions, download directly from the postgresql website at: https://www.postgresql.org/download/
- Express.js:
    - Can be installed directly through the command line through npm, detailed instructions here: https://expressjs.com/en/starter/installing.html
- React:
    - In order to install React, you will need to install a package manager. ‘npm’ (mentioned above) is a great package manager for javascript software. ‘Npm’ is automatically installed with Node.js, so follow the download link below.
Once npm installed, installing react is as simple as:
‘npm install --save react’

## Contribution Process 

- The contribution process is dependent on the concept of git flow and git branches. 
The repository consists of two main branches: "main" and "develop". 
The main branch is updated at the end of each sprint whereas the develop branch is updated after each feature is implemented. 
The contribution process is as follows:
	1) Create a new branch from "develop" and name it as "name_of_the_feature #[the user story number corresponding to the feature]"
	2) After the feature is implemented after passing all the test cases, a pull request into "develop" is created. 
	3) One of our group members will be responsible to review the code and accept the pull request. If a conflict occurs, the code reviewer and members involved in the conflict will communicate to resolve the issue.
	4) At the end of the sprint, "main" branch will pull from "develop"
